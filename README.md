# ✈️ Airline Crew Scheduling – Backtracking & Constraint Satisfaction

A mini-project demonstrating how airline crew assignment can be modeled as an **NP-Hard scheduling problem**, solved using **Backtracking + Constraint Satisfaction**.

This project is part of the **BCA (AI & DS)** curriculum and focuses on understanding the complexity, limitations, and practical relevance of exhaustive search methods.

## 📌 1. Problem Description

Airline crew scheduling requires assigning flights to crew members while ensuring operational constraints such as rest periods and non-overlapping timings. This project solves a simplified version of the problem using backtracking.

### **Given**

* A list of flights → `(Flight ID, Start Time, End Time)`
* A list of available crew members

### **Goal**

Assign flights to crew members such that:

✔ No overlapping flights
✔ Minimum rest time of **1 hour** between flights
✔ (Optional) Minimize cost or maximize fairness

## 📌 2. Algorithmic Strategy

| Component           | Description                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**          | Backtracking (Exhaustive Search)                                |
| **Domain**          | Airline Resource Allocation                                     |
| **Constraints**     | No overlap + mandatory rest time                                |
| **Time Complexity** | **O(k × 2ⁿ)** where *n = number of flights*, *k = crew members* |
| **NP-Hard?**        | Yes — structured like a constrained scheduling problem          |

## 📌 3. Features Implemented

✔ Constraint checker (overlap + rest time)
✔ Generates all valid assignments
✔ Recursive backtracking solution
✔ Time profiling for different input sizes
✔ Count of recursive calls
✔ Gantt chart visualization (optional)
✔ Execution-time vs number of flights plot

## 📌 4. Setup Instructions

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib memory_profiler
```

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```
crew_scheduling_notebook.ipynb
```

---

## 📌 5. Sample Output Format

Example mapping of crew members to assigned flights:

```json
{
  "C1": ["F1", "F4"],
  "C2": ["F2"],
  "C3": ["F3", "F5"]
}
```

## 📌 6. Insights & Conclusion

### **Strengths**

* Simple and easy to implement
* Always finds the correct valid solution
* Great for learning constraint satisfaction

### **Limitations**

* Exponential time complexity
* Very slow when flights exceed **10–12**
* Not practical for real airline datasets

### **Real-World Improvements**

* Heuristics (MRV, degree heuristic, forward checking)
* Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)
* Google OR-Tools
* Constraint solvers (Z3, PuLP)

# ⭐ **8. Analysis Section (For Your Notebook Submission)**

## **Why Airline Crew Scheduling is NP-Hard?**

Because each flight can be assigned in multiple ways, and constraints increase combinations exponentially.

For **n flights**, the possible subsets are:
**2ⁿ**

With **k crew members**, the total search space becomes:

```
O(k × 2ⁿ)
```

This exponential growth makes the problem **NP-hard**, similar to:

* Job scheduling
* Timetable generation
* Vehicle routing problems

---

## **Why Backtracking Works Only for Small Inputs?**

Backtracking explores *every valid combination*.
Even a small increase in flights (like 8 → 12) causes:

* Huge increase in recursion calls
* Memory jumps
* Execution time becomes very slow

Backtracking is feasible only for:

* Classroom problems
* Academic demonstrations
* Small datasets (<12 flights)

---

## **Where Backtracking Fails?**

When **n > 12 flights**:

* Millions of recursion calls
* Execution time grows drastically
* Memory usage increases
* System becomes slow or unresponsive

This demonstrates why airlines cannot use brute force and rely on **optimization algorithms instead**.
